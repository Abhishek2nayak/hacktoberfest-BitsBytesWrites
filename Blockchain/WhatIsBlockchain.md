# What Is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a specific type of data structure used to store and manage digital transactions across multiple computers in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof way. It is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions. These blocks are linked together using cryptographic hashes, ensuring the integrity and immutability of the data.

# Components of Blockchain
  1. Blocks
     Blocks are the fundamental units of a blockchain. Each block contains a group of transactions. Additionally, a block includes a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a chain of blocks.

  2. Transactions
     Transactions represent the data that is stored in the blockchain. These transactions can involve various types of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies or other forms of value.

  3. Cryptographic Hash
     Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block. This hash is a unique identifier and ensures the integrity of the entire blockchain. If any data in a block is altered, the hash will change, indicating tampering.

  4. Decentralization
     Blockchain operates on a decentralized network of computers (nodes). This means there is no central authority controlling the entire system. Decentralization enhances security and transparency.

  5. Consensus Mechanism
     Blockchain networks use consensus algorithms to agree on the validity of transactions and ensure the security of the system. Common consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).

# Types of Blockchain
Blockchain technology is not limited to cryptocurrencies; it finds applications in various fields. There are primarily three types of blockchains:

  1. Public Blockchain
     Public blockchains are open to anyone and everyone can participate in the network. These blockchains are secure, transparent, and decentralized. Examples include Bitcoin and Ethereum.

   2. Private Blockchain
     Private blockchains restrict access to a specific group of participants. These networks are often used by organizations for internal purposes. Private blockchains offer more control over the network but sacrifice some aspects of decentralization.

   3. Consortium Blockchain
     Consortium blockchains are semi-decentralized. They are governed by a group of organizations instead of a single entity. Consortium blockchains find applications in industries where multiple organizations collaborate on a shared platform.
