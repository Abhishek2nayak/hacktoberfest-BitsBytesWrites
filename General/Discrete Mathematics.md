# General/DiscreteMathematics

This is a guide to understanding the fundamentals of Discrete Mathematics.

## Introduction

Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with countable, distinct, and separated elements. It has applications in various fields, including computer science, cryptography, and engineering.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Logic and Proofs

This section covers propositional logic, predicate logic, and various proof techniques, including direct proofs, proof by contradiction, and mathematical induction.

### 2. Set Theory

Here, we explore the concepts of sets, set operations, Venn diagrams, set identities, and the cardinality of sets.

### 3. Combinatorics

Combinatorics involves the study of counting, permutations, combinations, and the binomial theorem. It also includes the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the pigeonhole principle.

### 4. Graph Theory

Graph theory deals with the study of graphs, including types of graphs, graph representations, and various graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm and the minimum spanning tree algorithm.

### 5. Discrete Probability

This section introduces the basics of discrete probability, including sample spaces, probability distributions, expected values, and variance.
