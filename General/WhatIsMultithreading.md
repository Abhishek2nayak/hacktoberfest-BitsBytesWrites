# What is Multithreading?
Introduction
Multithreading is a fundamental concept in computer science and software development. It plays a crucial role in improving the performance and responsiveness of applications by allowing them to execute multiple threads concurrently. In this guide, we will explore the concept of multithreading in detail, understanding what it is, how it works, and its practical applications.

## Understanding Threads
### What is a Thread?
A thread is the smallest unit of a CPU's execution. It represents a sequence of instructions that can be managed independently by the operating system. Threads within a process share the same memory space and resources, making them ideal for concurrent execution.
### Threads vs. Processes
This section will discuss the differences between threads and processes, highlighting when to use one over the other.
