# What Are Data Structures.

Data Structure is a way of organisation of data so that it can be used and manipulated accordingly. By organisation I mean storing the data in a particular format.Let's consider an example, suppose you want to buy an ice-cream and went to the stall to buy one, what you saw was a queue of people waiting for their turn to buy an ice cream. As soon as person recieves one he leaves the queue from the begining and soomeone who wants to buy it enters the queue from the end. Here each person denote a single data entity and the way this data gets manipulated i.e it gets inserted or removed defines the property of the particular data structure.

## Types of Data Stuctures.

The data strucutres are mainly classified into two types i.e 
- Linear Data structure 
- Non Linear Data Structure

### Linear Data Structure.

Linear Data Strucutures are those in which the data is organised in sequential manner one after the another, like that in the ice cream stall queue.
Linear Structures are as follows:
- Array
- LinkedList
- Stack
- Queue
- ArrayList

### Non Linear Data Strucutres

Non linear data structures are those in which the data is organised in non sequential manner, like that of the leaves in a tree.
Non linear Data Structures are as follows
- Trees
- Graphs
- Tries
