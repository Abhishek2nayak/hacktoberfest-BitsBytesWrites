# Artificial Intelligence in Space

## We are already using Artificial Intelligence to make our lives simpler on Earth, but can we use AI beyond the borders of our planet?
Nowadays, most of the companies, like NASA and Google, have already put up AI to search for new celestial bodies, life on other planets and even streamlining the jobs of astronauts when they are in space.

## AI & Machine Learning in Space functioning
Present day space exploration missions include AI and machine learning abilities in many areas of space functions containing mission planning and functioning, data collection, accurate navigation and guiding, and spacecraft maintenance. 

## Human exploration: Space, the Moon, and Mars
Today’s NASA exploration vision calls for renewed emphasis on human exploration of space, and it has a new space flight vehicle on the drawing board to support this vision. The Crew Exploration Vehicle has an ambitious agenda: support continued low-Earthorbit flights, transport astronauts back to the moon, support extended presence on the lunar surface, and eventually enable human travel to Mars. At first, considering AI’s future in the context of human exploration might seem illogical. After all, a key motivation for more intelligent science spacecraft is to extend remote space operations beyond human involvement. However, as human spaceflight moves beyond low Earth orbit, a number of key changes will occur. Longer tasks and increased difficulty will require improved handling of functions, plan management, crew scheduling, and other issues involving task coordination as well as functions of systems, vehicles, habitats, and robotics.

## Future Possibilities of using AI on spaceships.
In the future, using an AI powered spaceship will be often preferred. It could be a voice assistant piling up the data and predicting the next move or giving an accurate result of the distances and many such factors. 
A true Sci-fi fan will devote his time thinking about the spaceships fighting with the alien ones equipped by AI. It looks very fascinating to look upon the reel to be a real move in the forthcoming years.
 

## Space Rovers and how it uses AI
Rover is a machine which is used to collect information and samples from different planets. They are used to collect dust, rocks, and even take pictures. They are very useful in exploring the universe.
 
For example let us consider the use of AI in the rover called “Perseverance”, it was the latest rover launched by NASA to have a voyage on Mars.  Firstly it used AI in navigating or pinpointing the clues. It is a small instrument located at a 7 foot long arm. It is used to collect core samples and leave it there for future investigation. 
Next, it used one for the navigation of the rover. It is also used for landing or doing a variety of scientific tasks. Since the mission lasts for one Martian year (687 earth days), these AI equipped help will surely help in enduring life(of the rover) on mars as well as providing us with some stiff-backed information.
